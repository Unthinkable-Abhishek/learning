****  Chapter - 1  ****

1- createElement makes an object which has following things
    1- type - h1
    2- props
        1- attributes- id - objects
        2- children
        for multiple children pass it as array 

2- createRoot is responsible to assign a root inside react

3- render , converts the JS object into html which browser understands and render in on the screen
    putting the heading in the root, render will replace that and will put this in there 

4- Library and framework - react can only work in the place where we intends to like here root
    react can be applied to a small porting of a page, whatever place we make root as
    independently, some piece of code in js, gives helper methods to develop fast methods.
    framework comes with all lots of things
    framework may not be applied to the existing application, but we can use react in small section of a page

5- order of the script matters in index.html , react cdn link and then reactDOM cdn link
   as reactDOM wants react to render on the page
